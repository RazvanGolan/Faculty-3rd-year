# RISC Assembly Language Homework

## Requirements

This homework consists of exercises in RISC assembly language, demonstrating fundamental concepts such as input/output operations, memory handling, loops, procedures, and recursion. Each exercise builds upon the previous one to introduce more complex logic and control flow. Below are the descriptions and objectives of each exercise.

## **Exercise 1: Factorial Calculation for Array Elements**

### **Objective**:
- Read two values: `n` (the number of elements) and `m` (the starting memory address).
- Input `n` elements and store them starting at address `m`.
- For each element in the array, calculate the factorial and store the results in a designated area of memory.
- Print the factorial of each input element.

### **Instructions**:
1. Read the value of `n` and `m`.
2. Input `n` elements and store them in memory starting at address `m`.
3. Implement a factorial procedure that takes an integer input and returns its factorial.
4. Call the factorial procedure for each element in the array and store the results.
5. Print the factorials of the input elements.

## **Exercise 2: Bubble Sort Implementation**

### **Objective**:
- Read two values: `n` (the number of elements) and `m` (the starting memory address).
- Input `n` elements and store them starting at address `m`.
- Implement a bubble sort algorithm to sort the elements in ascending order.
- Print the sorted elements.

### **Instructions**:
1. Read the value of `n` and `m`.
2. Input `n` elements and store them in memory starting at address `m`.
3. Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort the elements stored at address `m`.
4. Print the sorted elements.

## **Prerequisites**:
- A working RISC simulator or emulator that supports input/output operations and memory handling.
- Basic understanding of assembly language, including registers, memory addressing, and control flow.

## **Acknowledgments**:
- These exercises are designed to teach basic concepts of assembly programming, including the use of loops, procedures, and sorting algorithms.
