# Requirements

This homework contains several exercises in RISC assembly language, demonstrating fundamental concepts such as input/output operations, memory handling, loops, procedures, and recursion. Each exercise builds upon the previous one to introduce more complex logic and control flow. Below are the descriptions and objectives of each exercise.

## **Exercise 1: Basic Input, Output, and Storage**

### **Objective**:
- Read two values: `n` (the number of elements) and `m` (the starting memory address).
- Input `n` elements, store them starting at address `m`, and print each element.

## **Exercise 2: Using Procedures (Subroutines)**

### **Objective**:
- Refactor the previous code to use a procedure for handling the input and storage of elements.
- The main program reads `n` and `m`, then calls a procedure that handles the loop for inputting and storing `n` elements.


## **Exercise 3: Fibonacci Check Using Procedures**

### **Objective**:
- Read `n` and `m` as in previous exercises.
- For each of the `n` input numbers, call a Fibonacci procedure to check if the number is a Fibonacci number.
- The Fibonacci procedure should return `1` if the number is in the Fibonacci sequence, and `0` otherwise.
- The result is stored and printed for each number.

## **Prerequisites**:
- A working RISC simulator or emulator that supports input/output operations and memory handling.
- Basic understanding of assembly language, including registers, memory addressing, and control flow.

## **Acknowledgments**:
- These exercises are designed to teach basic concepts of assembly programming, including the use of loops, procedures, and mathematical sequences like Fibonacci numbers.
